Atom SCRAPfy Plugin
======================

This is a simple plugin for [Atom](http://atom.io) to allow you for easily pasting code to SCRAPfy

It takes the current selection in a file or the entire text, uploads it to (by default) [SCRAPfy](http://scrapfy.io), and returns the URL to the clipboard.

Installation
------------

In Atom, go to Preferences > Packages. Search **SCRAPfy** and install it.

Usage
-----

Select some text (or don't) and hit `ctrl + alt + s` and afterwards `ctrl + v` - and you're good to go!
